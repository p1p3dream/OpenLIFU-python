# Sound speed: Labuda et al. 2022 (Ultrasonics, vol. 124, 106742) found no
# significant difference in speed of sound between gray and white matter,
# reporting 1532-1541 m/s across specimens. We use 1540 m/s for both GM and
# WM, consistent with the Aubry 2022 JASA benchmark (1560 m/s for
# undifferentiated brain) and IT'IS (1546 m/s). CSF speed of sound from
# IT'IS Foundation via Mueller et al. 2016 (J Neural Eng 13(5):056002).
#
# Density: IT'IS Foundation (BfS-2018-3615S82433 report).
#   GM: 1045 kg/m3, WM: 1041 kg/m3, CSF: 1007 kg/m3.
#
# Attenuation: Labuda et al. 2022 measured significantly higher attenuation
# in WM than GM. Values in Np/m from BabelBrain (Pichardo), derived by
# averaging IT'IS (0.25-0.75 MHz) and Labuda 2022 (3.5-10 MHz):
#   GM: 4.40 Np/m @ 1MHz -> 0.38 dB/cm/MHz
#   WM: 10.18 Np/m @ 1MHz -> 0.88 dB/cm/MHz
#   CSF: ~0.099 Np/m -> 0.009 dB/cm/MHz (essentially negligible)
# Conversion: Np/m * (8.686 dB/Np) / (100 cm/m) = dB/cm; at 1 MHz this
# equals dB/cm/MHz directly.

# Thermal properties: IT'IS Foundation (specific heat, thermal conductivity).

class ThresholdMRI(SegmentationMethod):
    """MRI-based segmentation using intensity thresholding and distance transforms.

    Segments an MRI volume into skull (outer shell), air (low-intensity
    cavities), and brain tissue regions, with optional sub-classification
    of brain tissue into CSF, gray matter, and white matter.

    When ``classify_brain_tissues`` is False (default), the brain interior
    is labeled as a single "tissue" material. The segmentation assigns four
    tissue types: water, skull, tissue, and air. When True, the brain
    interior is split into CSF, gray matter, and white matter using a
    3-component Gaussian Mixture Model (EM-GMM) on T1-weighted intensity.
    This yields a total of six assigned tissue types:
    water, skull, csf, gray_matter, white_matter, and air. Additional
    materials in the dict (e.g. standoff) are carried through but not
    assigned by the segmentation algorithm.

    The algorithm assumes standard T1-weighted MRI contrast where the head
    is brighter than background, and within the brain, white matter is
    brightest, gray matter intermediate, and CSF darkest. Volumes with
    different contrast (e.g. T2-weighted) will not classify brain tissues
    correctly.

    Each axis of the input volume must have at least 2 coordinate values
    so that voxel spacing can be computed. Coordinate spacing is assumed
    to be uniform along each axis.
